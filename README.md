Just Like Curiosity Rover which have it's own twitter account.
Curiosity Rover send it status by twitting post from Mars.
My robot also work similar. It's CrystalX which work at Jupiter it have Temperature Sensor, camera, and GPS.
It will post the Temperature information, status of camera or it's location only if you ask her by twitting 
with her name on twitter using any twitter account. 
This info can be seen by anyone who follow the crystalX on twitter. Advance AI can be use for more control on Crystalx.
